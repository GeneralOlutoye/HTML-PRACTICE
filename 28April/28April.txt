usually webpages are built so that users can be able to interact with 
the websites and have wonderful experineces.
such interactions are called events in javascript some of which include
*onclick - a property that listens for click events in javascript using 
    the onclick property. this is usally assigned a function.

*onchange - we can listen for change events in javascript using the 
    onchange property. This is also usually assigned a function.

*onmouseover - we can also listen for hover events using a special
property called onmouseover. 

*onMouseOut - 

*onMouseDown - This property is technichally the same as the onclick
    property just that it rhymes well with the onMouseup property. 

*onMouseup

*onLoad - This is a very interesting propertye because the action it listens
    to is the load action. Meaning it gets executed upon loading the page
